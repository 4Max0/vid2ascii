# About this Project

This is a small implementation of a Video to ASCII converter in python.

The python script takes a video as input (for example .mp4) and displays the video as an ASCII art in the terminal. 

This project uses the Libraries:
- cv2
- numpy
- sys
- os

You will need to install cv2 as a dependency, through pip for example.
